                " When naming java variables there are some rules and suggestions.\n" +
                "1. Variable names are case-sensitive. A variable's name can be any legal identifier â€” an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode\n" +
                " letters and digits, beginning with a letter, the dollar sign \"$\", or the underscore character \"_\". The convention, however, \n" +
                "is to always begin your variable names with a letter, not \"$\" or \"_\". Additionally, the dollar sign character, by convention,\n" +
                " is never used at all. You may find some situations where auto-generated names will contain the dollar sign, but your variable\n" +
                " names should always avoid using it. A similar convention exists for the underscore character; while it's technically legal to\n" +
                " begin your variable's name with \"_\", this practice is discouraged. White space is not permitted.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "2. Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters. Conventions (and common sense) apply\n" +
                " to this rule as well. When choosing a name for your variables, use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations. Doing so will\n" +
                " make your code easier to read and understand. In many cases it will also make your code self-documenting; fields named cadence,\n" +
                " speed, and gear, for example, are much more intuitive than abbreviated versions, such as s, c, and g. Also keep in mind that the\n" +
                " name you choose must not be a keyword or reserved word.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "3. If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word,\n" +
                " capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. The names gearRatio and currentGear are prime examples of this convention. If \n" +
                "your variable stores a constant value, such as static final int NUM_GEARS = 6, the convention changes slightly, capitalizing every \n" +
                "letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character. By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere.\n" +
